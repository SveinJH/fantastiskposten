# Fantastiskposten

##### Welcome to my **miniprosjekt** in the course *Systemutvikling 2* at NTNU Trondheim.<br/>
The project is an online community-newspaper where one can insert, edit, delete or read articles.<br/>

This project contains two smaller project, one for the client application, and one for the backend server.<br/>
In order to run the project, clone it and in each of the two **client** and **server** folders run `npm install`.<br/>
In the server project you also have to have Typescript installed globally with `npm i -g typescript`and thereafter run `tsc` in order to build the project.<br/>
In the client this is done automagically :)</br>

Keep also in mind that the development of this application was done in
Firefox Developer Edition with the CORS Anywhere addon enabled.</br>
This was in order to fix a couple issuses regarding CORS.</br>
A CORS proxy or the CORS Anywhere should be used when testing the app.</br>

#### Enjoy.
