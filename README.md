# Fantastiskposten

Welcome to my **miniprosjekt** in the course *Systemutvikling 2* at NTNU Trondheim.<br/>
The project is an online community-newspaper where one can insert, edit, delete or read articles.<br/>

This project contains two smaller project, one for the client application, and one for the backend server.<br/>
In order to run the project, clone it and in each of the two **'client'** and **'server'** folders run `npm install`.<br/>
In the server project you also have to have Typescript installed globally</br>
with `npm i -g typescript`</br> 
and thereafter run `tsc` in order to build the project.<br/>
In the client this is done automagically :)
